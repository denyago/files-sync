Everything in the cloud. But it's just a bunch of servers belonging to somebody.

Sync files to a local drive as Denys does.

**Yet another project I have started. Many thing to do.**

What it should bo eventually:

- [ ] Front page of my home sever
- [ ] Manage volumes of removable drive
- [ ] Mount GoCryptFS and monitor sync from Dropbox and Google Drive
- [ ] Sync photos from Google Photos
- [ ] also allow unmanaged by Google photos
- [ ] also de-duplicate photo if I add it, and it's present in my collection
- [ ] "fat jar" distribution. I hope a single binary one day
